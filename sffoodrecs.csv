Restaurant,Type,Yelp,Notes
Sparrow,Brunch,,"This was my favorite brunch spot!! It's on Haight st, and I went here almost every weekend. Try their open faced egg sandwich or their french toast!"
Little Skillet ,Brunch,,"They're famous for their chicken + waffles! Also, they have an in-house dj that plays some really solid blues."
The Mill ,Brunch,,"Fancy overpriced toast? Yeah, go here at least once. It's some of the best toast you'll ever have."
Craftsman and Wolves ,Brunch,,This place in the Mission is opened by a chef that won so many awards. Try The Rebel Within (an egg encased by a muffin)!
Tartine Bakery ,Brunch,,"In the Mission, this is one of the best bakeries in the city."
Black Sands Brewery,Brunch,,Another solid brunch spot in the Haight. 
Blue Bottle Coffee,Coffee,,"The place for real connoisseurs (which I am def not since I don't drink coffee.) Jack Dorsey swears by this place. Also, the affogato is really, really good."
Sightclass Coffee ,Coffee,,Super bougie coffee shop (think wood panels and warehouse setting) but the coffee (and affogato) is alright (and overpriced)!
Zero Zero,Pizza,,Pricey (~$20/pizza) but really good! Recommend getting the avocado toast and splitting a pizza with someone.
Pizzeria Delfina ,Pizza,,Super amazing authentic Italian pizza in the Mission! Try the burrata and any of their pizzas - you can't go wrong.
Mensho Tokyo ,Ramen,,"Literally the best ramen you'll ever have! It only opens for dinner and takes no reservations so get there right when it opens. You'll still probably have to wait 20min-2h, but it's 110% worth. I went at least 3x in my 3 months in SF."
Nojo Ramen ,Ramen,,Also one of the best ramen spots in the city! Mensho > Nojo imho though
Iza Ramen Lower Haight ,Ramen,,"Also a really great ramen spot, but can't compare to Nojo or Mensho."
Lers Ros Thai ,Lunch,,"Quality Thai food! Reserve in advance, esp. on weekends"
Cotogna,Lunch,,A super delicious Italian restaurant in North Beach
Straw,Lunch,,You have to try their famous donut burger (or chicken + waffles) at least once! This place is extremely extra but you have to go. It's carnival themed and the guest book they give you to sign is super fun!

Nopalito ,Dinner,,High class Mexican food in the Panhandle
Nara ,Dinner,,I love this sushi place/bar! Try the hamachi truffle with their sakes!

Souvla ,Dinner,,"Really, really good Greek food. I like their chicken salad and fries with garlic Greek yogurt sauce."
Ice Cream Bar (Cole Valley) ,Dessert,,They have delicious floats and handmade ice cream! The coconut almond vegan ice cream is literally better than most non-vegan ice creams.
Smitten Ice Cream,Dessert,,"Some of the best ice cream in SF! Using nitrogen to freeze it, the ice cream is really creamy. They do cool flavor combos such as red pepper ice cream with honey"
